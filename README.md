# Green's test playground for Angular.JS

This project holds mostly test apps for Green to play around with AngularJS.

This project is based on an application skeleton as provided by [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)
meant for this purpose, the angular-seed project.

Currently this holds 2 applications:

## Experimentation

Called 'gzzApp.experimentation' in the app/experimentation path, this is a pure
play area for me to test AngularJS syntax.

## Barchart

Called 'gzzBarchart' in the app/barchart path, this is a play area for custom
directives.  Currently the idea is for the user to be able to input two decimal
values: expected and actual.  They will then be drawn into a flat progress bar
of some kind.  Currently still a work in progress.
